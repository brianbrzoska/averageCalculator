# Basic Average Calculator

This project has two different calculator components that are inside. The first calculator is a GPA 
calculator. This calculator allows the user to enter the name of the class, the letter grade, and 
the credits in the class so that the web application can determine the GPA for the semester.

The second calculator is a Grade Average Calculator that can determine the grade you will receive
in a specific class during the semester. You are able to add the name of the assignment, the grade
percentage which is the grade that you received on that assignment, and the weight percentage of your
total grade in the class. For example, the assignment can be called "TEST 1", the GRADE% earned would
be a 95, and the WEIGHT% is 25% of your entire grade.

The reason that we created these two calculators was because we wanted to calculate our individual
grades for some of our courses. The GPA calculator was created so that we can take those grade
averages and calculator our GPA.
